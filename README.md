# movie-recommedation-system

In this project , I made use of tmdb credits and movies dataset.
Next, in this project i made use of python module named streamlit to create a single page website that will recommend a movie based on
1) Genre
2) Movie Director ,Casts
The website will not only recommend the movies but also the posters of the movies
for the extraction of the movie poster made use of python module named requests to extract the posters from tmdb site.
for the recommendation part made use of Nlp module.
